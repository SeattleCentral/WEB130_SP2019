                Boeing’s production cut catches suppliers and stock market off
                guard

                    Investors reacted harshly Monday to news that Boeing will
                    slash production of the 737 MAX, punishing the company’s 
                    share price and sending shock waves up and down the 
                    aerospace supply chain.

                    Boeing said Friday after the end of market trading that it 
                    would reduce the output of the beleaguered 737 MAX aircraft 
                    by around 20 percent, to 42 per month from the current rate 
                    of 52 per month, as it struggles with the continued fallout 
                    over two fatal 737 MAX crashes.

                    Boeing’s share price plunged by just over 5% Monday morning,
                    to a low of $371.86, before closing down 4.4% at $374.25, 
                    as markets weighed the implications of the cuts for an 
                    aircraft program that is expected to account for nearly a 
                    third of Boeing’s future revenues.

                    Monday’s stock-price swoon represented a total loss for 
                    investors of nearly $9.4 billion, and cut Boeing’s total 
                    market value to $211.4 billion. It was the fifth-largest 
                    price decline for Boeing stock in the volatile period since 
                    the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 on Oct. 29.

                    The production cuts won’t mean any layoffs for the 12,000 
                    or so workers at the Renton plant where the 737 MAX is 
                    assembled, the company said. But they do add to concerns 
                    that Boeing is facing a longer-than-expected delay in 
                    getting the grounded MAX aircraft back into the skies — or 
                    in meeting its own ambitious production goals.

                    Before the second crash of a 737 MAX — Ethiopian Airlines 
                    Flight 302, on March 10 — Boeing was planning to raise MAX 
                    output to 57 a month.

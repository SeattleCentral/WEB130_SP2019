            I enjoy writing code. Sometimes I get a little burnt out on writing
            code for work, so I'll take a break and learn a shiny new 
            programming language (for fun). It doesn't help that one of my favorite 
            hobbies is programming old computers.

            I also enjoy playing the violin, and I volunteer in the Mukilteo
            Community Orchestra. When it's time to disconnect from technology,
            my favorite thing to do is hike on a rainy day.
